weatherboard-wunderground
=========================
This is a modification of the default firmware for the now-defunct SparkFun Weatherboard environmental instruments package. This version is modified to calculate variables expected by Weather Underground, and works in concert with a data server/uploading device. See my other repositories for an Arduino based uploader to Weather Underground.

Code based very heavily on the original Weather Board firmware by Mike Grusin, and the WIMP Weather Station code by Nathan Siedle.

If you use this code, and ever meet him, you owe Nathan Siedle a beer :)
